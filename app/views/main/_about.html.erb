    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>I'm a Certified Scrum Product Owner, self-taught programmer, and educator with 10+ years of experience in public schools, inspired by the learning that is possible when every student has access to excellent teaching and high-quality materials. I've dedicated my career to improving educational outcomes, and I'd love to continue doing so.<p>
    <p>With a Masters degree in Curriculum and Instruction from the University of Connecticut and extensive classroom teaching experience, I have gained excellent communication and organization skills, strong problem solving abilities, and exceptional attention to detail. I consistently utilized project management principles throughout my teaching career by leading cross-functional teams of educators in the successful implementation of curriculum and instruction, resulting in improved student engagement and academic performance. Moreover, I am adept at building relationships with key stakeholders, facilitating teamwork, and navigating diverse perspectives to achieve shared goals.</p>
    <p>In addition to my education background, I hold a Certified Scrum Product Owner certification that underlines my expertise in agile methodology and my ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams. Furthermore, I possess the skills to maintain a product backlog, maximize the value of a product, and make effective decisions with end-users and business goals in mind.<p>
    <p>I aim to deliver products and solutions that make a positive impact in classrooms, leveraging a deep understanding of how schools operate and the challenges faced by students, teachers, and administrators. I'm excited to bring my perspective, skills, and experience to EdTech teams and develop innovative products that enhance the teaching and learning experiences of educators and their students. Though my expertise is primarily within the field of education, I'm certainly open to entering other industries and working with companies to develop products that drive positive outcomes for people.</p>
    <p>In my free time, you can usually find me being active or learning something new. I love playing tennis, pickleball, volleyball, hiking, and traveling & exploring cultures. I also enjoy cooking and playing with new ingredients.</p>
