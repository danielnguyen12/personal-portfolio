    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>I'm a teacher with over 10 years of experience in public schools, now making a transition into tech. Having witnessed firsthand the impact that technology can have in the classroom, I am motivated by the potential of digital innovation to transform education and improve outcomes for learners of all ages.</p>
    <p>My goal is to deliver products and solutions that can make a real difference in classrooms. Through my teaching experience, I gained a deep understanding of how schools operate and the challenges faced by students, teachers, and administrators. I'm excited to bring my perspective and experience to the tech industry and look forward to developing innovative products that will empower learners and improve educational outcomes globally.</p>
    <p>When I'm not coding, you can usually find me being active. I love playing tennis, hiking in nature, and exploring new destinations.</p>
