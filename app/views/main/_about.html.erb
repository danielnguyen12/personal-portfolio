    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>I'm a former teacher with over 10 years of experience in public schools, now making a transition into tech. Having witnessed firsthand the impact that technology can have in the classroom, I am motivated by the potential of digital innovation to transform education and improve outcomes for learners of all ages.</p>
    <p>My goal is to deliver products and solutions that can make a real difference in people's lives. I am excited to bring my perspective and experience to the tech industry and look forward to learning and growing in this new chapter of my career.</p>
    <p>When I'm not coding, you can usually find me being active. I love playing tennis, hiking in nature, cooking up new recipes, and exploring new destinations.</p>
